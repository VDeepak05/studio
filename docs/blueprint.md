## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated red (#F44336) to convey chaos, passion, and the heart of dating frustration.
- Background color: Light desaturated red (#FCE7E5) to set an unsettling but usable foundation for the app.
- Accent color: Analogous orange (#FF9800), brighter and more saturated than the primary, for highlighting disastrous elements.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines, for its elegant, fashionable, high-end feel contrasted against the chaos. 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Exaggerated CSS animations (confetti, explosions, shaking elements) on match failures and throughout the user experience to amplify comedic effect.
- Initially mimic a standard dating app layout, then introduce intentional misalignments and chaotic elements to disrupt usability and satirize dating app norms.
- Use standard dating app icons (hearts, chat bubbles) but apply visual glitches or humorous alterations (e.g., broken heart icon) to reinforce the comedic tone.
